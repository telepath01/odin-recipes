    <p class="paragraph">
      The Pastelon is a Christmas special within the Puerto Rican community.
      This delicacy is made from ground beef and uses plantains as the layers
      for the lasagna. The meat is seasoned to perfection by adding various
      spices and vegetables. The meat is then cooked slowly till complete. The
      dish is then ready to prepare. You start by cutting your plantains in
      strips, then you fry the plantains and lay them in the baking pan. After
      the first layer is placed then you place a layer of the meat. This process
      is repeated till the top layer is plantains. Lastly you take three eggs
      and whip them, pour the eggs on the dish and cook for 30 minutes or until
      golden brown at 350 degrees.
