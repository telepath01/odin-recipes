    <p class="paragraph">
      The stuffed manicotti is an all time favorite of mine. This dish brings
      the best of both worlds (pasta and cheese). The stuffing is prepared
      first, by mixing the cheeses together with the eggs. When the stuffing is
      complete you then pull out the baking pan and add marinara sauce to the
      bottom, this will be your first layer. Then you put the manicotti to boil,
      when the pasta is ready, you start stuffing each one and placing them one
      at a time on the sauce. When you have completed a layer of manicotti you
      then spread marinara sauce over the top and you finish by spreading your
      chesses evenly over the sauce. When the oven is ready you place your dish
      in for 45 minutes at a slow bake of 350 degrees. When the meal is cooked
      you can then cut into individual sections and enjoy.
